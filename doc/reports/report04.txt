#### Project progress ####
This past week consisted of more Django work. An admin interface was 
added, using the Django built-in modules. 

Also, a new Django application was added, called simple_qa. This was done 
because the initial models was considered (at the moment) more complex 
than needed to get the core functionality of the QA website to a working 
state. This new application uses a simplified model which only includes a 
search form definition as well as classes representing:

Package(name, category, version)
QAReport(qa_class, keywords, description, Package)

The data which is output by the pkgcore-checks data importer (in this 
project) is roughly what is needed for creating the model objects Package 
and QAReport. Yes, I am taking the easy way for now, it is entirely 
possible to extend the model definitions further up the road.

A search page and included functionality was added to the Django project 
as well, it is now possible to search the Package names by containing 
string.


### Where to go from here ####
Work on the search capabilities of the website. This means getting the 
search form to display and output the correct data.

When that is done, I would like to beautify it with some CSS, but 
perhaps it is more pressing to get the Python data importer fully 
functioal first. 

The JavaScript will have to wait until last moment.
