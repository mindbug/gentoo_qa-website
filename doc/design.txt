==== The design doc ====
    * Clear separation from the interface and the Python script.
    * The interface draws information from a database.
    * The database is loaded by the Python script in sub-project Constrictor.

==== Python Constrictor ====
    * The web interface demands data about a package.

==== The database ====
    The database will be used to function as a cache for the web service, because queries to such a database is faster and lighter than using pkgcore or any other PMS directly. (This needs confirmation though.)

    With database:
        Django works out-of-the-box.
        The Python script will be responsible for loading and syncing the database.

    Without database:
        Django must be configured to query pkgcore.
        Searches will probably be slow.
