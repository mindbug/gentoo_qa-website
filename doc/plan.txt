==== Administration ====
* Create a blog.
    * Create a category like gentoo-soc, profit.
* Contact robbat2@g.o. about shell access, provide ssh key.
* Ask ferringb if I need Trac, if so, contact patrick@g.o.


==== User stories ====
TODO clean this section up.

* Index page search form
    * User inputs text in textfield
    * User inputs text in textfield AND specifies criteria 
      (which database fields to include in the search) via 
      checkboxes. Should they always be visible?

* User wants to browse the database.
    * Include a menu with buttons like: browse by category,
      browse by keywords, browse by architecture? This would
      be very similar to a search query with criterias.

* User wants statistics about the database.
    * Display on index page?

* User wants statistics about packages.
    * Include in search form? Include in package query results?

* User searches by package name
* User searches by category name
* User searches by version
* User searches by keywords/architecture
* User searches by type of QA class
* User searches by any combination of the above


==== Tasks ====
* ASAP
    * Web UI user stories
    * Extract requirements
    * Define the database schema via Django models
    * Insert mock entries into database for testing UI
    * First UI sketch


==== Journal 06-14 -- 06-20 ====
Work on data importer on its way. Not done, but prints nicely to stdout. 
Next task is to make it write to a SQLite3 database. Next after that 
is to implement writing to MySQL.

Paused work in the importer to work on the web UI. Purpose is to figure 
out exactly what kind of data the importer needs to output. Work on the
web interface is underway.

Hopefully a rough and ugly web UI will be done by Monday morning.
