==== Notes ====
Uses the Django framework.
Uses AJAX where possible.
Uses CSS where possible.

The prefect form:
Use the escape filter in for all user-submitted data, like so:
    <input type="text" name="q" value="{{ query|escape }}" />

Use label html elements and useful contextual help.

Everything, especially user input must be validated for harmful intents.

If user has made any mistakes when filling out the form, the form should
be redisplayed with the mistakes highlighted and explained. The data
which was not erroneous should be prefilled so that user does not have to
reenter everything.
