==== Abstract ====
    The Gentoo x86 QA-website project aims to provide an interactive web interface to the pkgcore package management system (PMS).
    The data is QA data.
    The end-user is developers of the Gentoo x86 architecture.
    Secondary objectives include making the project able to use other PMSes and output formats.

====  Top-level design  ====
    The project is divided into two parts: 
        A website interface.
            Files: django_gentoo_pkg/*
        A data provider centered around the pkgcore PMS.
            Files: constrictor/*

====  The website interface  ====
    Uses the Django framework.
    Uses AJAX where possible.
    Uses CSS where possible.

====  The Python data digester  ====
    Prepares data about ebuild atoms (well, about the entire repository really) from pkgcore, so that the web framework can use this data and present that to the users.

==== Files ====
    README --  this file.
    doc/design.txt -- the project design document.
    doc/task_list.txt -- document which aims to divide the project into manageable tasks.
    doc/reports/* -- the weekly reports which are sent to the gentoo-soc mailing list.
    constrictor/* -- files which belong to the Python data importation sub-project, called constrictor.
    django_gentoo_pkg/* -- files which belong to the interactive web interface sub-project, it doesn't have a cool name yet.
